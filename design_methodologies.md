# Design Methodologies 
## Coupling and Cohesion
Key concepts in software engineering that are used to measure the quality of a software system's desgin. They are both important for determining scalability, reliability and maintainability of software's system.


**Coupling**- degree of interdependence between software modules. Closely connected modules are considered high coupling, where changes in one could affect others. When modules are indepenednt of eachother they have low coupling. **A good software design will have low coupling.**


**Cohesion**- degree to which elements within a module work together to fulfil one purpse. Closely related elements have high cohesion with a single purpose. Elements which are loosely related and have several purposes have low cohesion. **A good software design has high cohesion.**
